We use QtCreator as an IDE for Linux development on Ubuntu
Note: QtCreator is presently configured to use the V4L2 backend by default
go to 

mav@mav:~/workspaces/src/Libsense/librealsense$ 

sudo scripts/install_qt.sh (we also need qmake from the full qt5 distribution)
all.pro contains librealsense and all example applications
From the QtCreator top menu: Clean => Run QMake => Build
Built QtCreator projects will be placed into ./bin/debug or ./bin/release
We also provide a cmake file if you'd prefer to use your own favourite text editor
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
The library will be installed in /usr/local/lib and header files in /usr/local/include.
Note: If you would also like to compile the code examples use:
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=true
make && sudo make install
The example executables will build into ./examples and install into /usr/local/bin.
